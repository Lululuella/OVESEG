Description: An R package for multiple-group comparison to detect 
    tissue/cell-specific marker genes among subtypes. It provides functions to 
    compute OVESEG-test statistics, derive component weights in the mixture 
    null distribution model and estimate p-values from weightedly aggregated 
    permutations. Obtained posterior probabilities of component null hypotheses
    can also portrait all kinds of upregulation patterns among subtypes.
